# IoT-TelemedicinePorject
This project develops an IoT telemedicine system that streams real-time ECG data from an ESP8266-based device to a remote server using TCP sockets. The server stores and processes the ECG waveform in Python for cleaning, analysis, and visualization, enabling reliable remote biomedical monitoring.
